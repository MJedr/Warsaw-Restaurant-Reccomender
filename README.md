# Warsaw-Restaurant-Reccomender
To me it is always a problem to find a good restaurant (especially when I need to take my decision at once). 
I found out that many of bloggers recommendations does not fit my needs - when they suggest that the restaurant is great,
to me it is not as good. 
In this project I will try to build an objective recommendation system. The predictions will be based on:
- bloggers ratings,
- peoples reviews,
- distance from a given location.
# Prerequisites
